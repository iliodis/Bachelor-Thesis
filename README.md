# Bachelor-Thesis
My Bachelor Thesis is focused on using Artificial Neural Networks for the Mass-Radius relation of Neutron Stars in General Relativity and Modified Gravities.

I conduct my Thesis with Professor Nikolaos Stergioulas in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in his Gravitational Waves Group. In this repository I record my progress in this project. I upload the data used and the code written.
