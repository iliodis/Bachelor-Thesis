# Bachelor-Thesis
My Bachelor Thesis is focused on using Artificial Neural Networks for the Mass-Radius relation of Neutron Stars in General Relativity and Modified Gravities.

I conduct my Thesis with Professor Nikolaos Stergioulas in Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, in his Gravitational Waves Group. In this repository I record my progress in this project. Here, I upload the data used and the code written.

Until now I have been focused on finding the best tuning for Neutron Stars in GR and for two EOSs piecewise polytropic SLy and a tabulated). The best model so far has achieved accuracy over 99.9% and final loss below 10^{-4}!.
